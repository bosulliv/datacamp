### Random sample

  * ignore any grouping
  * take a random sample of population

### Stratified sample

  * split the population into groups
    * select an equal number of random samples from each group

### Cluster sample

  * split the population into groups
  * randomly pick some of the groups
    * use the entire population in each group selected

### Multistage sample

  * split the population into groups
  * randomly pick some of the groups
    * take a random sample from each group
  

## Principles of experimental design

  * Control: compare treatment of interest to a control group
  * Randomize: randomly assign subjects to treatments
  * Replicate: collect a sufficiently large sample within a study, or replicate the entire study
  * Block: account for the potential effect of confounding variables
    * Group subkects into blocks based on these variables
    * Randomise within each block to treatment groups

## Exploring the mtcars data set

Have you ever wondered whether there is a clear correlation between the gas consumption of a car and its weight?

```{r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
```

```{r chained, results = 'hide'}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(factor(cyl)) %>%
  ggvis(~mpg, ~wt, fill = ~cyl) %>%
  layer_points()
```

To answer this question, we first have to load the `dplyr` and `ggvis` packages. The `ggvis` plot gives us a nice visualization of the `mtcars` data set:

```{r ref.label = 'chained', echo = FALSE}
```

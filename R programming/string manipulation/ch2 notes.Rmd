# Chapter 2

```{r}
library(stringr)

my_toppings <- c("cheese", NA, NA)
my_toppings_and <- paste(c("", "", "and "), my_toppings, sep = "")

# Print my_toppings_and
my_toppings_and

# Use str_c() instead of paste(): my_toppings_str
my_toppings_str <- str_c(c("", "", "and "), my_toppings)

# Print my_toppings_str
my_toppings_str

# paste() my_toppings_and with collapse = ", "
paste(my_toppings_and, collapse = ", ")

# str_c() my_toppings_str with collapse = ", "
str_c(my_toppings_str, collapse = ", ")

```

I've missed an important subtlety with paste - as with all R functions, it's built for vectors. This example will drill the point home:

```{r}
col1 <- 1:3
col2 <- 4:5
col3 <- 7:9
p1 <- paste(col1, col2, col3)
p1
length(p1)
p1[1]
```

Or as a table below:

| col1 | col2 | col3 | paste |
|------|------|------|-------|
|   1  |   4  |   7  | 1 4 7 |
|   2  |   5  |   8  | 2 5 8 |
|   3  |   6  |   9  | 3 6 9 |

If any of the items are shorter than the others, then R's repeat rules apply.

Collapse then reduces the three strongs produced, into a single string.

I missed this subtlety originally - and just assumed it flattened vectors - it's doesn't: It matrix adds them as long columns.

```{r}

# Take a look at a few boy_names
head(boy_names)

# Find the length of all boy_names
boy_length <- str_length(boy_names)

# Take a look at a few lengths
head(boy_length)

# Find the length of all girl_names
girl_length <- str_length(girl_names)

# Find the difference in mean length
mean(girl_length) - mean(boy_length)

# Confirm str_length() works with factors
head(str_length(factor(boy_names)))

```
